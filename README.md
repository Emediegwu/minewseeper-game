# minewseeper-game
A basic Minesweeper game played on a Tkinter window, with Python.

This game is a copy version of JimShapedCoding's tutorial posted by freeCodeCamp on YouTube: Python Game Development Project Using OOP â€“ Minesweeper Tutorial (w/ Tkinter).

The video series can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqbGRZx4xUc

You can change the game difficulty simply by editing the numbers of cells and numbers of mines from settings.py.

Changes are welcome to the game.

You only get your win/loss message in the Python console, so look out for it!
